Additional features for the model
1. Consider batteries
2. Consider reserve markets
3. Consider temporal and spatial links between UC and ED (perhaps an additional input file is required)

Code issues
1. The definition of input and output folders is being done manually in each module. This should not be the case.
2. Start thinking of safety measures and warnings. 
3. Modules.txt must be in perfect order (for example unit commitment must be declared before basic_reserve, etc.).
This could be coded in a more user friendly way. 
4. Consider writing an excute.py file that searchs a unique path for the model.
